Fully automated grow tower system for modern happy farmers.

Vertical farming is an exiting field and the goal is to have a system in every house that basically takes care of itself. The growing is done in vertical tubes with slots cut and shaped for the plants. Water is sprayed inside the main tube powered by a waterpump. There is no soil in the grow tower instead we use water and air. The water pump cycles between on and off to let the roots get airrated but not dry or too wet. The tower stands on the water reservoir and the pump is placed inside the tank. In the reservoir the water is mixed with minerals and preferably in the future biodymanic compost tea. Need to experiment, please contribute.

The system is based on a Raspberry Pi platform and runs Apache and Python. The main code is monitoring the system and run a normal operation cycle. The cycle drives relays that turns on/off; water heater, water pump, grow lights and a heating/cooling-fan.

System has 4 sensors.
Water temperature
Air temperature
Humidity
Foto resistor
